# mod-graphql

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skomorokh/mod-graphql.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skomorokh/mod-graphql)

## Development

Install dependencies:

```
$ yarn install
```

Run the tests:

```
$ yarn test
```

## Recording Tests

`mod-graphql` uses the [yakbak][1] library to record interactions with
an okapi cluster. That way, there is no need to have a server up and
running in order to run the tests.

In order to re-record tests:

1. delete the `/tests/tapes` directory
2. startup your okapi gateway
3. log into to obtain a token
4. Create a file in your project root called `.env` and place the
values for your running gateway url, your tenant and your token inside
of it like so:

``` shell
OKAPI_URL=http://localhost:9130
OKAPI_TENANT=diku
OKAPI_TOKEN=abc123
```

5. Execute the tests by running `yarn test`

This will deposit new tapes with the recorded HTTP interactions into
the `/tests/tapes` directory which you can then check back into version.
